# üìö Library Passbook

I like to visit a library in my neighborhood with my son and borrow a few books every two weeks.
One day, one question has occurred to me, how much would it cost if I bought every single book which I borrowed from the library...
So, I created the app which helps me track books with its price like a passbook.
Someday, I'm expecting, it makes my son like reading books and gives us a sense of accomplishment!

We can make the book logs with keywords searching or scanning the barcode.
